# bioinfo2023
This is a repository created for Prof. Lu's 2023 Bioinformatics course.

Contents of the repository include:
* [In-class notes](https://StellariaL.github.io/bioinfo2023/in-class-notes.html)
* Self-study notes & reflections
* Homework codes
* etc.

**Here is my learning plan for this semester:**
* Get familiar with basic Linux, R and markdown syntax *(at least stop checking CDSN for every command or function I need)*
* Learn common representations of qualitative and quantitative biological data.
* Have a general understanding about common algorithms used to process biological data.
* Independently go through a few bioinformatic pipelines, or at least acquire the ability to do so.
* Create a personal collection of bioinformatic notes, tools and references for later usage.
