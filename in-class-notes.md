### Basics of bioinformatics
* Theoretic basics

  The coming age of bioinformatics: information exceeds interpretation tools. 
 
  How do we make use of the accumulating biological data? 
 
  * information: data produced by biological assays *(e.g. sequences from NGS)*
  * model: representation of structures underlying the data *(e.g. decision trees, neural networks)*
  
    *Models can be causal/interpretable or non-causal/uninterpretable.
  * algorithm: procedures to arrange and process data *(e.g. sorting, dynamic programming)*

* Practical basics

  List of needed skills:
  - [ ] Linux
  - [ ] R
  - [ ] *(optional)* Python
 
  Useful tools:
  * Docker *(virtual machine platform?)*
  * Github/git *(documentation & version control)*
  * Markdown *(language for easy typesetting)*

### Course information
* Theory + practice
* 9 homework projects + 1 10-min presentation
* Time & effort input
